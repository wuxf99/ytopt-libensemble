# This directory includes the examples for using ytopt and ytopt-libe to autotuning mixed kernel SVM simulations:

 1. Using ytopt to autotune the mixed-kernel-heterojunction (mkh) based on the original Heterojunction mixed-kernel SVM simulation from the GitHub repo: https://github.com/JennyMa0517/mixed-kernel-heterojunction.

 2. Using ytopt to autotune the mixed-kernel SVM simulation for processing HEP dector datasets (Smart Pixel dataset from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7331128).
